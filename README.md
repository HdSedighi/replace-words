# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The problem requires replacing words in a sentence with the shortest possible root from a dictionary. My first thought is to check each word in the sentence to see if it starts with any root from the dictionary. If a match is found, replace the word with that root. To ensure that the shortest root is used, the dictionary should be sorted by the length of the roots before performing the replacements.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. Sort the Dictionary: First, sort the dictionary by the length of the roots in ascending order. This ensures that the shortest root is considered first for replacement.
2. Split the Sentence: Split the sentence into individual words.
3. Replace Words: Iterate over each word in the sentence. For each word, iterate over the sorted list of roots. If a word starts with a root, replace the word with that root and move to the next word.
4. Reconstruct the Sentence: After processing all the words, join them back together to form the final sentence.
# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
-Sorting the dictionary takes O(dlogd) where d is the number of roots.

-Checking each word in the sentence against the roots takes O(w⋅d) where w is the number of words in the sentence and d is the number of roots.

-Overall, the time complexity is O(dlogd+w⋅d).

- Space complexity:

<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
- The space complexity is mainly due to the storage of the sentence's words and the sorted dictionary, so it is O(w+d).

# Code
```
public class Solution {
    public string ReplaceWords(IList<string> dictionary, string sentence) {
         // Convert dictionary to List<string> and sort by the length of the roots
        List<string> sortedDictionary = dictionary.OrderBy(root => root.Length).ToList();
        
        // Split the sentence into words
        string[] words = sentence.Split(' ');
        
        // Iterate over each word in the sentence
        for (int i = 0; i < words.Length; i++)
        {
            foreach (string root in sortedDictionary)
            {
                // If the word starts with the root, replace it
                if (words[i].StartsWith(root))
                {
                    words[i] = root;
                    break; // Move to the next word
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Join the words back into a sentence
        return string.Join(" ", words);
    }
}
```
